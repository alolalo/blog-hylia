My name is [Guus](#), UX/UI-designer that codes, and this blog is serves the purpose of logging my thoughts, processes and findings in a more contemporary way so I don't have to reverse engineer a pretty picture on my [portfolio]() to impress people.

All thoughts and opinions are my own. I created this blog for me in the first place, so you know for sure I'm not writing this for fame and fortune. It's place for me to store my work so I can forget about the stuff I'm dealing with, and look back some day on the progres.
