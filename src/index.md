This blog is simply a [decleration of independence]() for me, *a record of my freedom* and a place to log my thoughts, ideas and place to dogfeed my own design principles and practices. Both as a designer and a front-end developer.  

My freedom is thinking freely, finding my own religion and crafting my own solutions, principles and tooling. [All open source](#) as this page was rendered to you almost entirely using open source software and frameworks. 

I love to start from scratch as I believe that people who have nothing are the happiest; they don't have unreal expectations of some magical solution, and they also know they can't get any lower then where they are now. Ground zero is my domain, it's perfectly imperfect.

I hope that we come understand blogs are meant to be personal because as big blogging sites write for money. I don't write for money or recognition, but simply for me and share it online. Everything else happens after that by other people, out of my control; c'est la vie, c'est toi, c'est moi.

So for those who read this; it means a lot to me knowing I'm just doing this (b)logging solely for me. To hear myself think and trying to explain things to myself so I can read it again some day when my future self has the need to, and in return give you insight into my proces which you can value anyway you want, and can use my open sourced work anyway you want... 

I rate that five stars on a scale of near-perfectly-imperfect-perfection; it doesn't make me biased to write for fame or recognition, and you know someone is not selling you a story for clicks. 

For good and for worse; if something pisses you off about what I write, is not giving attribution to a person or work of open source, or is just simply dead wrong and inaccurate, and you just want to say "F&^$ you GUUS!"; simply visit www.fuckgu.us and let's take it offline so the internet doesn't remember our little fight üññ

I think more feminine despite my semi-worked out body that ‚Äúalpha... Alpha!... **ALPHA-MALE!**‚Äù. [This is how I think](), like how I'm writing this paragraph and that's why I like to keep a blog; It's a natural log of my brain's activity, thoughts and processes, not my bodies'. And for the record; I don't take selfies while working out. I don't take selfies at all, period. It's a form of vanity trying to control a hallucination of being able to capture beauty.

There is no escaping that, people judge you on your looks, which accounts for only 2% of your body's total mass, of which your body is the second thing you are, as you are your brain that makes up the remaining 98%. 

That's ok, we all make a calculus mistake like that sometimes, and then tell everyone simply how amazing that person is because ‚Äúyou never expected‚Äù that from them. That's actually not a nice thing to say you know, I say it's your bad.

It's your bad judgement making a biased judgement-call to objectify a person and you can't seem to intercept those thoughts as being arrogant. Because the only way I can surprise you if you had lower expectations of me before, showing you had them to begin with based on your *solid people skills* and ditto **experience**, quickly reached your own conclusions, never considered to ask an open question, only self-confirming ones that ‚Äúfit the picture‚Äù that you were looking for. 

Funny enough people you say this to do register it, it's just most people won't tell it straight to your face that your brain is failing you and I kindly refuse your ‚Äúgesture‚Äù since it's wrapped like a present but actually is a pile of hypocrite bullshit; you say I impressed you, but can I ask what did you think of me before that?...

The lie tastes sweet in the beginning, and bitter in the end. I'm bitter-sweet from beginning to end, so don't judge my tone of voice for being bitter. There is sweatness at the end of my grittyness, it's just that you need it to taste bitter first so you know what you don't want (again) first. 

Stop lying to your self and face your own hallucinating ego that is on a quest to rule the world so you can "save all people" with your enlightened insight. You're not perfect, nor am I. We're perfectly imperfect and that's the highest level of perfection you can achieve. So please regard this paragraph as a lie, because reading it probably tastes like sweetness and you thinking "he's right!".

I once thought sweatness first too by thinking I could build my own design system as a UI/UX designer, doing design & (cough) code, oversimplifying my ambitions and expectations out of sheer unknowingness of the development-side of things. 

I know how to code, but programming is something else. The difference being coding is more like an abstract mark-up language such as HTML & CSS, describing things like a paragraph of text. 

Programming is more like designing the structure of things and how the described things in the mark-up should behave. Programming is far more dynamic and knows many programming languages to create your desired behaviour, where coding is relatively static if you consider HTML, CSS, YAML & MD are all mark-up languages. 

It's a deeper layer that is fundementally different because you write it for someone else, where writing in HTML & CSS doesn't have to be used by somebody else (besides your peers), just a device to render it on. The same goes for creating a design system; you have to write it for somebody else, and make it useful so they can create their DS with it.

Designing a design system is a lot like programming. Luckily I'm persistent enough to figure things out, and quite resourcefull in fixing my own itch. [insert picture of balcony here]()

I can write pseudo-code and work out the logic of complex things.  But what I didn't figure out in the beginning is that I needed a mentor that knows how to design a system from scratch, and just started doing everything myself. You start searching repos for inspiration, finding some things of interest, and trying to see if you can make their frameworks work the way you want...

Failing as I go, believing I could do it and still going strong today, I learned quite a lot but most importantly that I'm not experienced enough to do it alone. Today I'm taking a more humble approach here to computer science at large, and to understand that holistically you need lifetime experience which I don't have. 

I'm learning it linearly right now, from the beginning. I've got the foundation and the will to do it and for me it's a personal reward to learn something new by experimenting with something that used to scare the living shit out of me; programming.

There's a big plus-side to going on your own hunt; you discover a lot of repositories that inspire and throw a curve-ball at what you are making. I hated Terminal.app, but I love using it as it's just to awesome to see everything run all the time and live-reloading changes that are the end product. I'm infected by "The Grabs" for sure. 

As a designer you hit a wall when you can only code, and you then know what you didn't know back then; I can code but I can't program. And it's very easy to reach out to tooling that will do the job for you like Adobe XD, Framer X, Figma if instant-development is what you seek.  Some will probably teach you how to code while doing it, as that's how I learned most of my coding skills. You reverse engineer how it works.

There's nothing quite like fixing your own solution from scratch, something you've seen develop over time and guided to where you wanted it to land. I've built Revolver DS in Sketch myself to fix the fatigue of "design systems for Sketch". They're not design systems, they're not connected to any code, they're just component libraries with terrible naming conventions and symbol structuring.

As a designer who wants to keep up with development, Sketch slows you down to much and forces you to adopt Figma, Framer and the likes. So at some point you hit a wall you know a tool can't fix. You know the only way you will get to have your design system work the way you want is to build it yourself and open source is the first resort.

I'm choosing a different approach as many developers recommend getting a SOLID foundation first, and then choose a framework if you need it. Personally I like to start from scratch so everything is clean from the ground-up, and I don't mind failing at first.

I believe in the foreseeable future designers will become front-end designers that can code. I wish to be one of the first as front-end developer that can [program](), by using and hopefully teaching people how to use it. 

Actually, hopefully I'm not teaching them because that shows the READ.me sucked to begin with, but I like to teach people what I've learned and that's not something of lately. I wanted to become a teacher when I was young, but didn't know what kind of teacher. Know when I'm 36, I know.

Many claim that front-end is way harder then back-end these days, as much of back-end is settled in standards. Front-end is like the wild-wild-west, and everybody has a shot at the gold. 

from now development language will pivot towards simplicity and flatness, making it available to all, rather then complexity and nesting things, making it accessible for the few. 

In my own words; I hope in the future development will become far more visual √°nd physical so we can all draw interfaces together in a virtual environment while being in the same room or remote. That sounds to crazy for now but I don't think I'm too far off. Anyway, back to reality...

Wanting to find "[the holy-grail DS]()", only to find out that what I wanted can only be done properly in code, not Sketch. Sketch is to limited to do the things you can easily do in code, such as calculating the color-ramps and mathematically applying type-scales instead of hardcoded values. My 

Sketch is my friend, my best perfectly imperfect friend that enables so many around me, no-coders and coders alike, to make something that they can communicate with. A design system will not solve your "inconsistency", enabling people to use it in their own free-form will.

Something tangible like a clickable prototype my girlfriend made to show an improvement that would solve quite some tickets for the product advocate team.
