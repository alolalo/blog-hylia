Hylia is a lightweight [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) starter kit with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) pre-configured, so that you can one-click install a progressive, accessible blog in minutes. It also gives you a well organised starting point to extend yourself.

This blog uses [Hylia](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/andybelldesign/hylia) by [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/andybelldesign) as a static site generator based on [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) and is powered by the designer-friendly [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). <br>I highly recommend you take it for a spin using this [Netlify Starter Kit](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/andybelldesign/hylia), especially if you **can't code**, that deploys a site + CMS in just three clicks.
