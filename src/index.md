Chizzle, chizzle, *chizzle*... Development is my sizzle to chizzle. These are my thoughts, ideas and executions of good and bad ideas I chizzle on. 

All my base belongs to me, so therefor I write as who I want to be; *Free* with a capital F because tech is what made sharing this possible in the first place. 

Technology is **FreeDOM** 

This blog is simply a [decleration of independence]() for me, *a record of my freedom*. My freedom is thinking freely, finding my own religion and crafting my own solutions, principles and tooling. [All open source]().

I'm a happy designer & developer because of it, not crappy and unhappy that I write for fame & fortune, posing as an authority because I'm not happy with myself and need “followers” to feel important. 

If I don't believe me, you don't believe me. I believe me to be a logical holistic thinker, a spiritual old soul, and a lesbian-orriented brain who likes to keep things simple insightfull & delightfull.

Like how for the [first 23 weeks]() of your life your body didn't decide on it's sexes yet, which makes your brain a-sexual to begin. 

This is reflected in Eastern Phylosophy by Ying-Yang, the symbol that represents the perfect balance between the *male*- and **feminine** side of the brain. 

Yes, you read it correct; the Chinese have known for [thousands of years]() our brain is both male and feminine in thinking, and our bodies are not. Therefor you are your brain first, then your body. 

Let nobody tell you otherwise as your brain came first, therefor what you think you are is what you are first. I'm the best lesbian boyfriend my girlfriend ever had. No joke...

I think more feminine despite my semi-worked out body that “alpha... Alpha!... **ALPHA-MALE!**”. [This is how I think](), like how I'm writing this paragraph and that's why I like to keep a blog; It's a natural log of my brain's activity, not my bodies'.

There is no escaping that, people judge you on your looks, which accounts for only 2% of your body's total mass, of which your body is the second thing you are, as you are your brain that makes up the remaining 98%. 

That's ok, we all make a calculus mistake like that sometimes, and then tell everyone simply how amazing that person is because “you never expected” that from them. That's actually not a nice thing to say you know, I say it's your bad.

It's your bad judgement making a biased judgement-call that you can't seem to intercept on someone you don't know. Because the only way I can surprise you if you had lower expectations of me before, showing you had them to begin with based on your *solid people skills* and ditto **experience**, quickly reached your own conclusions, never considered to ask an open question, only self-confirming ones that “fit the picture” that you were looking for. 

If you go look for an enemy, you will find it. I'm just watching people and observing their behaviour. People are greedy, especially white people. They have grown accustomed to ask everything to those

Funny enough people do register it, it's just most people won't tell it straight to your face that your brain is failing you and I kindly refuse your “gesture” since it's wrapped like a present but actually is a pile of hypocrite bullshit. 

I'm an intellectual, so praise me like an intellectual. If I'm a peasant, then praise me like a peasant with a beer. I love special beers, the really good stuff. Crafted to perfection.

But don't come barging in with your homebrewed shit like it's the best thing I will ever taste. Chances are I already had a taste of yours, it just had a different label. Key take-away here moonshiner; [don't label people]()

This blog uses [Hylia](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/andybelldesign/hylia) by [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/andybelldesign) as a static site generator based on [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) and is powered by the designer-friendly [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). <br>I highly recommend you take it for a spin using this [Netlify Starter Kit](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/andybelldesign/hylia), especially if you **can't code**, that deploys a site + CMS in just three clicks.
