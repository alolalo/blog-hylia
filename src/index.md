My name is [Guus](#), UX/UI-designer that codes, and this blog is serves the purpose of logging my thoughts, processes and findings in a more contemporary way so I don't have to reverse engineer a pretty picture on my [portfolio]() to impress people.

All thoughts and opinions are my own, as I created this blog for me in the first place, so you know for sure I'm not trying to fake it towards writing this for fame and fortune. Every positive has a negative
