This blog is simply a [decleration of independence]() for me, *a record of my freedom*. My freedom is thinking freely, finding my own religion and crafting my own solutions, principles and tooling. [All open source](#) 

I'm a happy designer & developer because of it, not crappy and unhappy that I write for fame & fortune, posing as an authority because I'm not happy with myself and need “followers” to feel important. 

If I don't believe me, you don't believe me. I believe me to be a logical holistic thinker, a spiritual old soul, and a lesbian-orriented brain who likes to keep things simple insightfull & delightfull.

Like how for the [first 23 weeks]() of your life your body didn't decide on it's sexes yet, which makes your brain a-sexual to begin. 

This is reflected in Eastern Phylosophy by Ying-Yang, the symbol that represents the perfect balance between the *male*- and **feminine** side of the brain. 

Yes, you read it correct; the Chinese have known for [thousands of years]() our brain is both male and feminine in thinking, and our bodies are not. Therefor you are your brain first, then your body. 

Let nobody tell you otherwise as your brain came first, therefor what you think you are is what you are first. I'm the best lesbian boyfriend my girlfriend ever had. No joke...

I think more feminine despite my semi-worked out body that “alpha... Alpha!... **ALPHA-MALE!**”. [This is how I think](), like how I'm writing this paragraph and that's why I like to keep a blog; It's a natural log of my brain's activity, not my bodies'.

There is no escaping that, people judge you on your looks, which accounts for only 2% of your body's total mass, of which your body is the second thing you are, as you are your brain that makes up the remaining 98%. 

That's ok, we all make a calculus mistake like that sometimes, and then tell everyone simply how amazing that person is because “you never expected” that from them. That's actually not a nice thing to say you know, I say it's your bad.

It's your bad judgement making a biased judgement-call that you can't seem to intercept on someone you don't know. Because the only way I can surprise you if you had lower expectations of me before, showing you had them to begin with based on your *solid people skills* and ditto **experience**, quickly reached your own conclusions, never considered to ask an open question, only self-confirming ones that “fit the picture” that you were looking for. 

If you go look for an enemy, you will find it. I'm just watching people and observing their behaviour. People are greedy, especially white people. They have grown accustomed to ask everything to those

Funny enough people do register it, it's just most people won't tell it straight to your face that your brain is failing you and I kindly refuse your “gesture” since it's wrapped like a present but actually is a pile of hypocrite bullshit. 

The lie tastes sweet in the beginning, and bitter in the end. I'm bitter-sweet.

Know what "that" stuff tastes like. [dogfeed]() that shit, and learn to chow it down to develop a taste for these "secret" recipes. Because everything else is simply a controlled hallucination of what a future projection of ultimate security, absolutism; Solved.

I once thought this too by thinking I could build my own design system as a designer, oversimplifying my ambitions and expectations out of sheer unknowingness of the development side of things. I know how to code, but programming is something else. 

Designing a design system is a lot like programming, and I can't program. Luckily I'm persistent enough to figure things out, and quite resourcefull in fixing my own itch. [insert picture of balcony here]()

I can't do everything myself, I accepted that from the beginning, but I didn't accept is that I sucked at programming. I can write pseudo-code and work out the logic of things.  But what I didn't figure out soon enough is that I needed a mentor that knows how to design a system, and just started doing everything myself. Failing as I go, believing I could do it.

There's a plus-side to that; you discover a lot of repositories that inspire you if they have a proper READ.ME that explains what it does. I hate the fucking terminal, but I love using it as it's just to awesome to see everything run all the time and live-reloading changes that you know are dev-ready. I'm infected for sure. 

As a designer you hit a wall and you then know what you don't know; I can't code. And it's very easy to reach out to tooling that will do the job for you like Adobe XD, Framer X, Figma if develpment is what you seek. 

There's nothing quite like fixing your own solution from scratch, and since I've built Revolver DS in Sketch myself I know for sure I must persue an independent approach. Period. Fix it myself because nobody will build what I want.

What I learned from building Revolver DS using Sketch using a visual interface, is that it's very easy to think in components. But limited by the abilities from Sketch, and knowing that I wanted to build something more dynamically, I discovered [utility-first] design systems like Tachyons and Tailwind were really up my alley.

As a designer who wants to keep up with development, Sketch slows you down to much and forces you to adopt Figma, Framer and the likes. So at some point you hit a wall you know a tool can't fix. You know the only way you will get to have your design system work the way you want is to build it yourself and open source is the first resort.

I'm choosing differently as I believe in the foreseeable future designers will become front-end designers that can code. I wish to be one of the first as front-end developer that can [program](), by using and hopefully teaching people how to use it. 

Actually, hopefully I'm not teaching them because that shows the READ.me sucked to begin with, but I like to teach people what I've learned and that's not something of lately. I wanted to become a teacher when I was young, but didn't know what kind of teacher. Know when I'm 36, I know.

Many claim that front-end is way harder then back-end these days, as much of back-end is settled in standards. Front-end is like the wild-wild-west, and everybody has a shot at the gold. 

from now development language will pivot towards simplicity and flatness, making it available to all, rather then complexity and nesting things, making it accessible for the few. 

In my own words; I hope in the future development will become far more visual ánd physical so we can all draw interfaces together in a virtual environment while being in the same room or remote. That sounds to crazy for now but I don't think I'm too far off. Anyway, back to reality...

Wanting to find "[the holy-grail DS]()", only to find out that what I wanted can only be done properly in code, not Sketch. Sketch is to limited to do the things you can easily do in code, such as calculating the color-ramps and mathematically applying type-scales instead of hardcoded values. My 

Sketch is my friend, my best perfectly imperfect friend that enables so many around me, no-coders and coders alike, to make something that they can communicate with. A design system will not solve your "inconsistency", enabling people to use it in their own free-form will.

Something tangible like a clickable prototype my girlfriend made to show an improvement that would solve quite some tickets for the product advocate team.

This blog uses [Hylia](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/andybelldesign/hylia) by [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/andybelldesign) as a static site generator based on [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) and is powered by the designer-friendly [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). <br>I highly recommend you take it for a spin using this [Netlify Starter Kit](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/andybelldesign/hylia), especially if you **can't code**, that deploys a site + CMS in just three clicks.
